# Official Repo of the paper "An investigation of belief-free DRL and MCTS for inspection and maintenance planning"

Paper link: [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s43065-024-00098-9.pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s43065-024-00098-9.pdf)

The code for the paper was first managed without Github, and only now pushed at a later stage without much testing and documentation. So, likely the code is quite messy and I cannot guarantee that it works. 

I also do not have an official requirements.txt, but going through the codes, here are some packages I used:
- numpy
- scipy 
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- pathos
- torch
